# Convex + ReactFlow example

This is a simple example of how to use Convex with ReactFlow.

Just click to create nodes, and connect them with edges by dragging from the
handles.

[ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) is a popular library for building flow charts and diagrams.

[Convex](https://convex.dev/) is a reactive database with serverless functions
for building full-stack apps. It can replace your whole backend (except serving
the html/css/js for your frontend).

It uses [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication.
By default, it uses a username/password auth flow, but there's also an
anonymous login, and you could add other auth providers, like Google,
GitHub, Apple, etc.

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t get-convex/reactflow-example
```

For more information on how to configure Convex Auth, check out the [Convex Auth docs](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/).

For more examples of different Convex Auth flows, check out this [example repo](https://www.convex.dev/templates/convex-auth).
